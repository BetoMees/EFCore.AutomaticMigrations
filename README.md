# Studying EFCore for Automatic Migrations

During my journey of studying Entity Framework Core (EFCore) and exploring how to implement automatic migrations similar to what was available in the .NET Framework, I stumbled upon an existing solution that perfectly fits the bill. The project I discovered is [EFCore.AutomaticMigrations](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EFCore.AutomaticMigrations) available on NuGet.

## Project Overview

[EFCore.AutomaticMigrations](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EFCore.AutomaticMigrations) is a project that simplifies the process of handling database schema changes and migrations in Entity Framework Core. It provides functionality similar to the automatic migrations feature that was available in the .NET Framework's Entity Framework.

## Why Use EFCore.AutomaticMigrations?

EFCore.AutomaticMigrations offers several advantages:

1. **Automatic Migrations:** Just like the .NET Framework's Entity Framework, it allows you to automatically update the database schema as your data model changes. This can save you a lot of time and effort when working on evolving database schemas.

2. **Simplified Workflow:** The tool simplifies the process of handling database migrations by automating many of the steps required to update the database schema.

3. **Seamless Integration:** It integrates seamlessly with Entity Framework Core, so you can continue to use EFCore's features while benefiting from automatic migrations.

## How to Use EFCore.AutomaticMigrations

To get started with EFCore.AutomaticMigrations, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install the NuGet Package:** Install the [EFCore.AutomaticMigrations NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EFCore.AutomaticMigrations) in your project.

2. **Configure Migrations:** Set up your Entity Framework Core DbContext and configure migrations using EFCore.AutomaticMigrations.

3. **Update Your Model:** As you make changes to your data model, the package will automatically generate migration scripts to update the database schema.

For detailed instructions and examples, you can refer to the [official documentation](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EFCore.AutomaticMigrations) of the EFCore.AutomaticMigrations package.

## Note

It's worth noting that the code available in the [EFCore.AutomaticMigrations GitHub repository](https://github.com/joaope/EFCore.AutomaticMigrations) is essentially a decoded version of the project available on NuGet. Therefore, if you're interested in understanding how the library works, you can explore the code on GitHub.

In conclusion, if you're looking for a solution to implement automatic migrations in Entity Framework Core, I highly recommend checking out [EFCore.AutomaticMigrations](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EFCore.AutomaticMigrations). It's a powerful tool that can streamline the database migration process in your EFCore projects, saving you time and effort.
